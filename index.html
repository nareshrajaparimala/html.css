            <h1><u>Steve Jobs</u></h1>
            <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American businessman who was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.
            </p><p> <br>
                Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics.
            </p><p> <br>
                In 1985, Jobs departed Apple after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO, John Sculley.[3] That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The Graphics Group eventually spun off independently as Pixar, producing the first 3D computer-animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and becoming a leading animation studio, producing over 27 films since.
            </p><p> <br>
                In 1997, Jobs returned to Apple as CEO after the company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely responsible for reviving Apple, which was on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with British designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products and services that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning with the "Think different" advertising campaign, and leading to the iMac, iTunes, Mac OS X, Apple Store, iPod, iTunes Store, iPhone, App Store, and iPad. In 2003, Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor in 2011, at the age of 56, with Tim Cook succeeding him as CEO of Apple. In 2022, he was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

            <h2><u><b>Information on Steve jobs</b></u></h2>
            <p>Steve Jobs, born in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, was an iconic American entrepreneur and visionary. Co-founder of Apple Inc., Jobs played a pivotal role in revolutionizing the technology industry. He started his journey in the early 1970s when he co-founded Apple with Steve Wozniak, initially operating from his family's garage. Their first successful product, the Apple II, marked the beginning of a new era in personal computing.
            </p><p> <br>
                Despite his early successes, Jobs faced significant challenges in his career. In 1985, due to internal conflicts, he was ousted from Apple, the company he helped create. This setback led him to establish NeXT Computer and acquire Pixar Animation Studios. Although NeXT struggled in the computer market, Pixar thrived, producing groundbreaking animated films like "Toy Story."
            </p><p> <br>   
                Jobs' triumphant return to Apple came in 1997 when Apple acquired NeXT, bringing him back as the company's CEO. He revitalized Apple's product lineup, introducing innovations like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. These devices not only redefined their respective industries but also transformed the way people live, work, and communicate.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                One of Jobs' defining characteristics was his relentless pursuit of excellence in both product design and user experience. He insisted on creating elegant, user-friendly products, setting Apple apart as a leader in innovation and design.
