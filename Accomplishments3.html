            <p>Steve Jobs' accomplishments are a testament to his visionary leadership and impact on the technology industry. Co-founding Apple Inc. in 1976, he played a pivotal role in shaping the personal computer revolution with products like the Apple I and Apple II. His return to Apple in 1997 marked a turning point as he revitalized the company and launched iconic products such as the iMac. The introduction of iTunes and the iPod revolutionized the music industry, while the iPhone, released in 2007, redefined the smartphone and communication landscape. Jobs' App Store concept transformed mobile devices, and the iPad created a new category of tablet computing. His emphasis on user-centric design set a high standard, making Apple products both functional and aesthetically pleasing. His leadership extended to Pixar Animation Studios, where he oversaw the creation of successful animated films like "Toy Story." Steve Jobs' inspirational leadership and innovation continue to influence technology, design, and entrepreneurship, even after his passing in 2011.</p>

            <h2><b>Innovations and designs</b></h2>
            <p>
                Jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism. In India, he experienced Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey,[234] and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied.[234] Jobs gained insights regarding industrial designs from Richard Sapper.[235]
</p><p><br>
According to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original design...".[236][237] Daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of Jobs, stated: "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing person."[238]
</p><p><br>
He is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards, and packages. His contributions to most of his patents were to "the look and feel of the product". He and his industrial design chief Jonathan Ive are named for 200 of the patents.[239] Most of these are design patents as opposed to utility patents or inventions; they are specific product designs such as both original and lamp-style iMacs, and PowerBook G4 Titanium.[240][241] He holds 43 issued US patents on inventions.[240] The patent on the Mac OS X Dock user interface with "magnification" feature was issued the day before he died.[242] Although Jobs had little involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers,[237] Jobs later used his CEO position to directly involve himself with product design.[243]
</p><p><br>
Involved in many projects throughout his career was his long-time marketing executive and confidant Joanna Hoffman, known as one of the few employees at Apple and NeXT who could successfully stand up to Jobs while also engaging with him.[244]
</p><p><br>
Even while terminally ill in the hospital, Jobs sketched new devices that would hold the iPad in a hospital bed.[212] He despised the oxygen monitor on his finger, and suggested ways to revise the design for simplicity.[245]
</p><p><br>
Since his death, he has won 141 patents. He holds over 450 patents in total.

<h3><b>Apple 1</b></h3>
<p>
    Although entirely designed by Steve Wozniak, Jobs had the idea of selling the desktop computer, which led to the formation of Apple Computer in 1976. Both Jobs and Wozniak constructed several of the Apple I prototypes by hand, funded by selling some of their belongings. Eventually, 200 units were produced.[73]


</p>

<h3><b>Apple 2</b></h3>
<p>
    The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products,[81] designed primarily by Wozniak while Jobs oversaw the development of the Apple II's unusual case[247] and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply.[79] It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer Faire by Jobs and Wozniak as the first consumer product sold by Apple.

<h3>
    Apple Lisa
</h3>
<p>
    The Lisa is a personal computer developed by Apple from 1978 and sold in the early 1980s. It is the first personal computer with a graphical user interface for business users.[248] The Lisa sold poorly at 100,000 units.[249]
</p><p><br>
In 1982, after Jobs was forced out of the Lisa project,[250] he took over the Macintosh project, adding inspiration from Lisa. The final Lisa 2/10 was modified and sold as the Macintosh XL.
</p>

<h3><b>Macintosh</b></h3>
<img style="float:left" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/Steve_Jobs.jpg/340px-Steve_Jobs.jpg"height="175"width="145">
<p>
    Once he joined the Macintosh team, Jobs took over the project after Wozniak had experienced a traumatic airplane accident and temporarily left the company.[93] Jobs launched the Macintosh on January 24, 1984, as the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse.[252] This first model was later renamed to Macintosh 128k among the prolific series. Since 1998, Apple has phased out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", though the product family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since inception. The Macintosh was introduced by a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, "1984".[253] It aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, received as a "watershed event"[254] and a "masterpiece".[255] Regis McKenna called the ad "more successful than the Mac itself".[256] It uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) to save humanity from the conformity of IBM's domination of the computer industry. The ad alludes to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes a dystopian future ruled by a televised "Big Brother".[257][258]
</p><p><br>
The Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64 for consumers, and the IBM Personal Computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses.[259] Macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade.

<h2><b>NeXT Computer</b></h2>
<p>
    After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started NeXT, a workstation computer company. The NeXT Computer was introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event. Using the NeXT Computer, Tim Berners-Lee created the world's first web browser, the WorldWideWeb. The NeXT Computer's operating system, named NeXTSTEP, begat Darwin, which is now the foundation of most of Apple's operating systems such as Macintosh's macOS and iPhone's iOS.[260][261]

<h3><b>iMac</b></h3>
<p>Apple iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's".[262] Described as "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac and since has varied the shape, color and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a "breathing" light effect when the computer went to sleep.[263] The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also featured forward-thinking changes, such as eschewing the floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to USB for connecting peripherals. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's success, in the interface being popularized among third-party peripheral makers—as evidenced by the fact that many early USB peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac design).[264]</p>
<h3><b>iTunes</b></h3>
<p>
    iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by Apple. It is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video (as well as other types of media available on the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the macOS and Microsoft Windows operating systems. The iTunes Store is also available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad.

Through the iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, audiobooks, podcasts, movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward). Application software for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch can be downloaded from the App Store.

<h3><b>iPod</b></h3>
<p>
    The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8" hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to players at that time. The capacity of the first-generation iPod ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB.[265] The iPod sold for US$399 and more than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001. The introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming a major player in the music industry.[266] Also, the iPod's success prepared the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone.[267] After the first few generations of iPod, Apple released the touchscreen iPod Touch, the reduced-size iPod Mini and iPod Nano, and the screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years.[266]

<h3><b>iPhone</b></h3>
<p>
    Apple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were aware of its release. Time declared it "Invention of the Year" for 2007 and included it in the All-TIME 100 Gadgets list in 2010, in the category of Communication.[268] The completed iPhone had multimedia capabilities and functioned as a quad-band touch screen smartphone. A year later, the iPhone 3G was released in July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller.[269] The iPhone 4 was thinner than previous models, had a five megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p HD, and added a secondary front-facing camera for video calls.[270] A major feature of the iPhone 4S, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition.

<h3><b>iPad</b></h3>
<p>
    The iPad is an iOS-based line of tablet computers designed and marketed by Apple. The first iPad was released on April 3, 2010. The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPad includes built-in Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity on select models. As of April 2015, more than 250 million iPads have been sold.
